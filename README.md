The following data analysis is investigating the function of 2 cell integrin signalling receptors in muscle regneration(alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha 7 beta 1). 
The minimium Feret's diameter is a measurmen of the diameter of the muscle fibres of the mice as measured under the microscope. The mice were split into 4 groups, the first is a wildtype (WT; a natural mouse), followed by either an a5 or a7 knockout (knockout means the receptor is not present) and finally a double knockout of a5 and a7. 

Each mouse had a cross section of the tibialis anterior taken and sectioned into 4 samples and placed on a microscopy slide. The slide was then fixed and 4 images of each sample were taken, apart from the 4th sample of each slide which was a control. This was repeated 3 times for each genotype(WT,a5,a7 and double knockout) producing 12 images for each slide and 36 images for each genotype. In each image the muscle fibres were drawn around and the minimium feret's diameter taken.
